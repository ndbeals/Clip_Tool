--- GMOD 13 update 10/3/13
- changed all networking to use net library
- significantly improved the performance of the draw hook for each clip
- significantly improved performance of the clip previewing
- removed "Render inside" option as it was rarely used, and wasted frame time
- Updated how it saves clip data for dupes, old clips still work due to compat.lua
- removed the "refresh clips" button, as it i shouldn't be needed anymore
- rolled the functionality of both tools into one.
- added a Number Scratch (the blue ball thing) on the distance, pitch and yaw sliders, these allow you to go into extreme detail.
